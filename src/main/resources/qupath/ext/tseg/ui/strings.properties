help.instructions = 1. Download the inference script from [https://github.com/ae-aydin/tseg-qupath-inf] (either by cloning the repository or downloading the ZIP archive).\n\
\t- Python > 3.8\n\
\t- [https://www.python.org/downloads]\n\
\n\
2. Run *setup.bat* (for Windows) or *setup.sh* (for Linux and macOS) to prepare the inference folder.\n\
\t- This will create virtual environment and some folders.\n\
\n\
3. Obtain a YOLO-seg model (.pt, single class - 0: Tumor) for segmentation.\n\
\t- Our current model segments stained tumor areas most effectively.\n\
\t- [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LjO4FIN06ZCgs-9Zrwyu5m5ZLDDCekSf/view?usp=sharing]\n\
\n\
4. Place the model inside the "tseg-qupath-inf/models" directory and rename it to "model.pt" if required.\n\
\n\
5. In QuPath, select a ROI using the rectangle tool and ensure it is selected.\n\
\n\
6. Open the "Extensions > TSEG > Segment" window within QuPath and select the "tseg-qupath-inf" directory using the directory chooser.\n\
\n\
7. Change inference arguments if needed and click the *Segment Selected Region* button to initiate the segmentation process.
