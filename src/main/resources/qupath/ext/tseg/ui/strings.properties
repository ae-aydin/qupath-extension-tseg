help.instructions = 1. Download the inference script from \
   https://github.com/ae-aydin/tseg-qupath-inf (either by cloning the repository or downloading the ZIP archive).\n\
\n\
2. Run setup.bat (for Windows) or setup.sh (for Unix-based systems) to prepare the inference folder.\n\
\n\
3. Obtain a YOLO-seg model (.pt) for segmentation.\n\
\n\
4. Place the model inside the tseg-qupath-inf/models directory and rename it to 'model.pt'.\n\
\n\
5. In QuPath, select a Region of Interest (ROI) using the rectangle tool and ensure it is selected.\n\
\n\
6. Open the Extensions > TSEG > Segment window within QuPath and select the tseg-qupath-inf directory using the directory chooser.\n\
\n\
7. Change inference arguments if needed and click the "Segment Selected Region" button to initiate the segmentation process.

ext.dir_chooser = Select Python Project Directory (contains '.venv', 'main.py', and 'models/model.pt')

run.no_roi = NO ROI SELECTED!

run.running = RUNNING...

run.done = FINISHED!
