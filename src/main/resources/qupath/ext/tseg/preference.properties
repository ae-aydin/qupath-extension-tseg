label.tileSize=Tile Image Size
desc.tileSize=Size (in pixels) for each image tile processed during inference. Must match the trained architecture.
label.tileTargetMPP=Target MPP
desc.tileTargetMPP=Microns-per-pixel (MPP) resolution for tiles used in inference. Should match the value used for model training (e.g., 1.0 for 1mpp).
label.tileOverlap=Adjacent Tile Overlap Ratio
desc.tileOverlap=Fractional overlap (0.0-1.0) between adjacent tiles.
label.tileExtension=Tile Image Format
desc.tileExtension=File format for exported tiles (e.g. jpg, png, tif).
label.defaultModel=Default Model
desc.defaultModel=Preferred model to use.
label.confidence=Model Confidence
desc.confidence=Minimum confidence score (0.0-1.0) required to accept a model prediction. Increase to reduce false positives; decrease to accept more uncertain results.
